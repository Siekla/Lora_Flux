**Ari, a female King Charles Spaniel, lies on her back on a bed, stretched out and relaxed.** Her black and white fur contrasts with the grey comforter and the red and white Christmas-patterned blanket. Her head is slightly turned to the left, and her expression is calm. The indoor lighting is soft and natural, creating a cozy, domestic atmosphere. The focus remains on Ari, with no other elements distracting from the scene.
