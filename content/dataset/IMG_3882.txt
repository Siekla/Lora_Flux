Ari, a black and white Cavalier King Charles Spaniel, walks in a grassy area wearing a pink collar and leash. She is facing downward, possibly sniffing the ground. The leash extends into the background, which consists of grass in various shades of green and brown. The natural daylight casts soft shadows, creating a calm outdoor atmosphere with a slight background blur that keeps the focus on Ari.
