Ari, a Cavalier King Charles Spaniel, sits on a green blanket with a somewhat surprised or worried expression. Her black and white fur contrasts with the bright green blanket, and her floppy ears frame her calm yet attentive face. The natural indoor lighting gently illuminates her, creating a relaxed atmosphere in a casual home setting. The pale off-white wall in the background adds to the peaceful, neutral mood.
