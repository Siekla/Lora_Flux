Ari, a Cavalier King Charles Spaniel, is holding a green spiky bone-shaped toy in her mouth. Her black and white fur is smooth, and her wide eyes are focused on the toy, showing curiosity or mild concern. The background is blurred, featuring a light-colored tiled floor in an indoor setting. Natural lighting highlights the details of her fur and the toyâ€™s texture. The composition centers Ari in the frame, making her facial features, expression, and interaction with the toy clearly visible.
