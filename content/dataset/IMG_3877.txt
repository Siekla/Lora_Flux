A close-up of Ari, a Cavalier King Charles Spaniel, looking directly at the camera. His brown, black, and white fur is well-groomed, and his expression is neutral. The dark gray background, decorated with white and gold snowflakes, contrasts with his fur. The lighting highlights his features, making him the clear focal point of the image.
