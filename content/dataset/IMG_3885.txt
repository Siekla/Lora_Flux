Ari, a Cavalier King Charles Spaniel, rests curled up on a green corduroy couch, tucked under a blue blanket. Her smooth, glossy fur is white, black, and reddish-brown, and her gentle expression shows relaxation. Her ears are up, and her gaze is directed downward, indicating a calm, restful state. The natural, bright lighting highlights her as the central focus, with the background softly blurred, creating a peaceful, cozy indoor atmosphere.
